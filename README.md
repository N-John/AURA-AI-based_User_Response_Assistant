Aura is a minimal basic natural language built to run on microprocessors 
with minimal storage space. It is ment for raspberry pi pico running micropython.
It can recieve sms sent via gsm and based on the message and predefined data, it responds appropriately.
it supports a modifiable database which can be set appropriately for desired environment.
AURA can also perform other multiple functions such as: read, write, store and delete sms, make and receive
calls schedule multiple gsm actions. It should be noted that this is still an ongoing project.
